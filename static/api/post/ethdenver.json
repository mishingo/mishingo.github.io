    "content": "Me and my team essentially set out to build a platform that allows people to get together and go on strike against online services, leveraging ethereums blockchain to maintain accountability of the voting process. We found amongst our group that we thought Facebook was taking advantage of it's users, and (unsuprisingly we developed this before the facebook privacy scandal broke news). We decided that our example campaign for the hackathon would be to allow a strike against facebook to happen, and block user access to the site through a browser extension. \n\n None of us on my team had much blockchain development experience, so we were a little nervous about the outcome, but we managed to hook into metamask and deploy a solidity contract on our test rpc before midnight. The hardest part was creating an extension that could communicate with another extension to access web3. I still remember my eyes burning red from eye strain trying to figure out how to do this. Unfortunately the sun was coming up and I was exhausted. We put together an example of how the processs would look like and it looked pretty good. It wasn't until a couple of days later that I continued tinkering with the app that I found a really hacky solution, but it worked! \n\n Me and my group are still in contact, and we might continue to persue building this app, only time will tell.
